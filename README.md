This repo stores Docker and CI files that allows Gielve to automatically build and push to production latest [nearcore](https://github.com/nearprotocol/nearcore) releases.

## Tutorial

You can find the tutorial which goes with this repo on [Hugo's blog](https://blog.hugomasclet.com/deploy-near-validator-node-kubernetes/). It is still a WIP and it will be improved regularly.
